# Java code for "Linearity of a drug response curve observed and explained in a hybrid model for SARS–CoV–2".

The Java file uses the Hybrid Autmata Library (HAL) software package, for more information see https://halloworld.org/.

On the one hand, our code examines the experimental probability of extinction for SARS-CoV-2 infection, while on the other hand it serves as a tool to understand the former by producing data on offspring distribution.
